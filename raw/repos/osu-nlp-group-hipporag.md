  HippoRAG 2 bridges RAG and true long-term memory by using knowledge graphs
  with personalized PageRank to enable multi-hop associativity and
  sense-making—this mimics human memory consolidation mechanisms, allowing LLMs
  to build persistent, interconnected knowledge representations that improve
  over time without fine-tuning.

### HippoRAG 2 is a powerful memory framework for LLMs that enhances their ability to recognize and utilize connections in new knowledge—mirroring a key function of human long-term memory.

Our experiments show that HippoRAG 2 improves associativity (multi-hop retrieval) and sense-making (the process of integrating large and complex contexts) in even the most advanced RAG systems, without sacrificing their performance on simpler tasks.

Like its predecessor, HippoRAG 2 remains cost and latency efficient in online processes, while using significantly fewer resources for offline indexing compared to other graph-based solutions such as GraphRAG, RAPTOR, and LightRAG.

categories, bringing it one step closer to true long-term memory.

## Installation

```sh
conda create -n hipporag python=3.10
conda activate hipporag
pip install hipporag
```
Initialize the environmental variables and activate the environment:

```sh
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3
export HF_HOME=<path to Huggingface home directory>
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your openai api key>   # if you want to use OpenAI model

conda activate hipporag
```

## Quick Start

### OpenAI Models

This simple example will illustrate how to use `hipporag` with any OpenAI model:

```python
from hipporag import HippoRAG

# Prepare datasets and evaluation
docs = [
    "Oliver Badman is a politician.",
    "George Rankin is a politician.",
    "Thomas Marwick is a politician.",
    "Cinderella attended the royal ball.",
    "The prince used the lost glass slipper to search the kingdom.",
    "When the slipper fit perfectly, Cinderella was reunited with the prince.",
    "Erik Hort's birthplace is Montebello.",
    "Marina is bom in Minsk.",
    "Montebello is a part of Rockland County."
]

save_dir = 'outputs'# Define save directory for HippoRAG objects (each LLM/Embedding model combination will create a new subdirectory)
llm_model_name = 'gpt-4o-mini' # Any OpenAI model name
embedding_model_name = 'nvidia/NV-Embed-v2'# Embedding model name (NV-Embed, GritLM or Contriever for now)

#Startup a HippoRAG instance
hipporag = HippoRAG(save_dir=save_dir, 
                    llm_model_name=llm_model_name,
                    embedding_model_name=embedding_model_name) 

#Run indexing
hipporag.index(docs=docs)

#Separate Retrieval & QA
queries = [
    "What is George Rankin's occupation?",
    "How did Cinderella reach her happy ending?",
    "What county is Erik Hort's birthplace a part of?"
]

retrieval_results = hipporag.retrieve(queries=queries, num_to_retrieve=2)
qa_results = hipporag.rag_qa(retrieval_results)

#Combined Retrieval & QA
rag_results = hipporag.rag_qa(queries=queries)

#For Evaluation
answers = [
    ["Politician"],
    ["By going to the ball."],
    ["Rockland County"]
]

gold_docs = [
    ["George Rankin is a politician."],
    ["Cinderella attended the royal ball.",
    "The prince used the lost glass slipper to search the kingdom.",
    "When the slipper fit perfectly, Cinderella was reunited with the prince."],
    ["Erik Hort's birthplace is Montebello.",
    "Montebello is a part of Rockland County."]
]
